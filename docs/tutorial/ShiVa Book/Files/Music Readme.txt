20 Royalty FREE Music loops - part 1 - Psionic 2008

I created these short 1 bar to 4 bar loops in FL STUDIO 8 and converted them to ogg to save on the filesizes/bandwidth, you can convert them back to wavs using oggDrop from the ogg vorbis website (search for ogg on the net) or most other music convertors!!

I didn't use mp3 because it adds a short pause at the beginning which destroys the looping of the sample!!





This music is FREE to use however you see like. Use it for Personal, Commercial, Flash Games, 2D/3D games etc with the exception of including the loops in something like a Commercial sample dvd/cd/online collection.

Other than that if you want to add the files to your site for free download please credit me as and include this file:-
